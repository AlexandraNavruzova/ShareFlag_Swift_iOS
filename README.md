# ShareFlag_Swift_iOS

This is my solution to the Milestone project from a Hacking with Swift tutorial.
This app can show a table of flags with preview pictures. A new DetailViewController shows up when a cell with the flag is tapped. There is a UIActivityViewController in the navigation controller that helps to share an image or save it to the image library.
